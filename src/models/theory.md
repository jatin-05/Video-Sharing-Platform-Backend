there is something called monodb aggregate pipeline 
 What It Is:
Instead of retrieving all documents and processing them in your application code, the aggregation pipeline allows you to process data within the database, making operations faster and more efficient.


üì¶ What is mongodb-aggregate-paginate?
It‚Äôs a helper or plugin that makes it easier to apply pagination (i.e., page number, limit per page) to MongoDB aggregation pipelines, especially when using Mongoose (a popular MongoDB ODM for Node.js).

üîÑ Why Use It?
The MongoDB aggregation pipeline is powerful, but manually adding pagination (using $skip and $limit) and getting total counts can be repetitive and error-prone. These plugins wrap that logic and make it simple.









bcrypt is a password-hashing library used to securely store passwords.(using bcrypt in this project n[])
bcryptjs is a JavaScript implementation of bcrypt, used for hashing passwords‚Äîjust like bcrypt, but written in pure JavaScript.

    üîç bcrypt vs bcryptjs:
    Feature	                             bcrypt (native)	bcryptjs (pure JS)
    Language	                Uses native C++ bindings	Written in pure JavaScript
    Speed	                 Faster (uses compiled code)	Slower
    Platform   	Needs native build tools (like node-gyp)	Works anywhere (no build tools)
    Usage	                       Better for production	Easier for quick setups/testing
